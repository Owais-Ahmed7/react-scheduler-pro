## General Guidelines

- If adding a new feature, write the corresponding test
- Ensure that nothing get broke. You can use the playground for that
<!-- - If applicable, update the [documentation](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify-doc) -->

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

- _Node:_ `^16.0.0`
- _Yarn_

### Install

Clone the repository and create a local branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify.git
cd react-toastify

git checkout -b my-branch
```

## Developing

How it works ? The library don't use a state management library like redux or mobx to dispatch the notifications. Instead it uses a dead simple pubsub.

```sh
# launch the playground
yarn start

# Run tests ðŸ’©
yarn test

# Prettify all the things
yarn prettier
```

### Project structure

#### Scss

All the style rules lives in the `scss` directory. The filename are self-explanatory about their content.

#### Example dir

The playground let you test your changes, it's like the demo of react-scheduler-pro. Most of the time you don't need to modify it unless you add new features.
